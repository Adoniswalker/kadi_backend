# Introduction

**Kadi** is a Kenyan card game for 2-5 players using a standard 54-card deck. Fast-paced and simple to pick up, Kadi is perfect for an engaging, lively game night.

## Objective

The aim of Kadi is to be the first player to play all designated winning cards in a single turn.

## Card Types

The standard 54-card deck is used, comprising four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs) and two Jokers. Each suit includes 13 cards: Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King. In Kadi, these cards hold specific roles:

- **Jump Cards**: Jack (J)
- **Question Cards**: Queen (Q) and 8
- **Kickback Cards**: King (K)
- **Answer Cards**: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and Ace (A)
- **Penalty Cards**: 2, 3, and Jokers (JOK)

## Dealing

The dealer shuffles the deck, dealing 3 or 4 cards per player based on the total players. Remaining cards form the draw pile, with the top card turned face-up to initiate the discard pile.

### Restrictions for the Starting Card

The following cards cannot start the discard pile:

- 2 and 3 (Penalty Cards)
- Question Cards
- Kickback Cards
- Jump Cards
- Joker Cards
- Ace Cards

If one of these cards is drawn, itâ€™s returned to the draw pile, the deck reshuffled, and a new top card is selected to start the game.

## Rules

1. **Starting the Game**: The previous winner (or the dealer in a new game) begins play and sets the direction.
2. **Playing Cards**: Each player must match the suit or rank of the discard pile's top card.
    - Failure to match results in drawing a card from the draw pile.
    - If unable to play any card, the player must draw a card.
3. **Special Card Rules**:
    - **Question Card**: Must be played with a matching Answer Card. If unavailable, the player draws a card.
    - **Jump Card**: Skips the next player unless countered by another Jump Card from that player.
    - **Kickback Card**: Reverses play direction. The next player can counter with another Kickback Card.
    - **Ace Card**: Allows the player to declare a suit for the next player. If not declared, the game proceeds normally.
    - **Multiple Special Cards**: Players can play multiple Jump or Kickback Cards to stack effects.
4. **Announcing Victory**: A player anticipating a win must announce "Niko Kadi" during their turn. Failure to announce prohibits victory.
5. **Empty Draw Pile**: If the draw pile depletes, shuffle the discard pile (excluding the top card) to replenish it.
6. **Penalty Cards**:
    - **2, 3, and Joker Cards**: Result in the next player drawing 2, 3, or 5 cards, respectively.
    - Players can evade penalties by:
        - Playing a Penalty Card of the same rank.
        - Playing an Ace, which maintains the previous Penalty Card suit.
    - **Joker Play Continuation**: After a Joker, play proceeds with the suit/rank from the preceding Penalty Card.

## Winning

To win, a player must play all winning cards in a single turn and must have announced "Niko Kadi" in the previous round. Players cannot win if another player has no cards remaining.

**Winning Cards**:

- **Answer Cards**
- **Question Cards** accompanied by their matching Answer Cards.
